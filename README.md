# The Green Ribbon
## Interactive story

Small web project developed for my "Narrative Structures" course, together with the animator Diego Alcocer.

The story is taken from the book "In a Dark, Dark Room, and Other Scary Stories", by Alvin Schwartz.

The project is a quick homework, so the CSS code is a little bit messy.
The results may not display as well on other computers, as I developed mainly for my screen size.
